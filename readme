John Urban segment of code in UDR.html is in javascript and is used to zoom in and out (open source)

UDR.html uses CSS (Cascading Style Sheets); the content is all html files

Geometric images --- the (0, 0) position is the upper-left-hand corner of the page
  circle     for letters on the chart have (x, y) as center and a default radius 10
  rectangle  for distributions on the chart;  use (x1, y1, x2, y2) to define top left and bottom right corners
  polygon    for arrows on the chart; use (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ...) to define corners
